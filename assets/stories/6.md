Dear Shubhangi ji 
I just wanted to say thank you so so much for everything you've done for me. With your help, I've lost 17 kgs + the extra fat accumulation 💪🏻💪🏻 and that's changed my life. Not only did I lose weight, but I also got to reduce my blood pressure medicines and thyroid medicines, which is amazing.
What I loved most about working with you is that you understood my busy schedule and gave me advice that was easy to follow. You were always there to support and guide me, and that made all the difference. 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Your care and expertise and the way of approaching the request have made a huge impact on my health, and I'm so grateful for that. Thank you again for being such an amazing diet doctor to us 🙏🏻🙏🏻
