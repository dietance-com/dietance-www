### Instructions

1.  **Prep the Cabbage:** For crisp cabbage, not mushy, proper preparation is key. Cut the cabbage into four quarters and soak it in warm water for about 2 minutes. Then, remove the cabbage and rinse it several times in cold water. Drain it completely, as any leftover moisture can make the stir-fry soggy.
2.  **Prepare the Vegetables:** While the cabbage drains, wash the carrots and bell peppers. Dry them thoroughly and julienne or shred all of the vegetables.
3.  **Start the Stir-Fry:** Heat your pan with oil over high heat. Add the chopped garlic and green chilies, and sauté for a minute until they become fragrant.
4.  **Add the Vegetables:** Add the prepped cabbage, carrots, and bell peppers to the pan. **Stir-fry for only 2 to 3 minutes.** The goal is to cook the vegetables just enough so they are tender-crisp. Keep the heat on high to maintain the classic stir-fry crunch.
5.  **Season and Finish:** Push the vegetables to the side of the pan. Add the salt, pepper, soy sauce, and vinegar directly into the hot oil. This helps the seasonings bloom and coat the vegetables evenly. Quickly toss all the ingredients together. Continue to stir-fry for another minute—be careful not to overcook.
6.  **Serve:** Transfer the stir-fry to a serving bowl and enjoy immediately.
